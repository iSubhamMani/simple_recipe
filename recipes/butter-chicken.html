        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.
            <br>
            It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter sauce.
            <br>
            Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.
