                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the onion, garlic, and red bell pepper, and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. 
                            Stir in the McCormick® Ground Paprika, McCormick® Smoked Paprika, McCormick® Ground Cumin, McCormick® Ground Cayenne, McCormick® Gourmet Organic Ground Coriander, McCormick® Crushed Red Pepper, 
                            and salt, and cook until fragrant, about 45 seconds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Crack the eggs directly into the tomato sauce, spacing evenly. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 30 seconds, 
                            then uncover and continue cooking until the eggs 
                            have set and the whites are fully cooked through, 2–3 minutes more.
